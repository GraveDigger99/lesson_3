          A galaxy is a massive and gravitationally bound system which is
          comprised of stars (like the
          <span title="planet" class="sun">Sun</span>), stellar remnants
          (compact stars), an interstellar medium of gas and dust, as well as
          the important, but misunderstood, <span>dark matter</span> - a matter
          hypothesized to account for gravitational effects that appear to be
          the result of invisible mass.

          Galaxies can range in size from a dwarf with as few as ten million
          stars to massive giant galaxies with a hundred trillion stars. Each
          star orbits its galaxies own centre of mass and it is estimated that
          there are more than <span id="count">170 billion galaxies</span> in
          the observable universe. Lets dive in to explore many more galaxy
          facts!

          There are about 170 billion galaxies in the observable universe. Each
          of these galaxies has different stories to tell when it comes to their
          origins. So how do galaxies form?
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          The universe is so big that light from distant galaxies takes millions
          or even billions of years to reach us. By the time it reaches us, what
          we actually see is what it looked like in the past. That is the reason
          why nearer galaxies look more developed than those farther from us.
          Figuratively, the further we look into space, the more we go back in
          time.

          There was a time when we thought that the Milky Way was the only
          galaxy out there. It changed when the big and bright Andromeda was
          discovered. However, before it became known as a galaxy, it was
          previously called the “Great Andromeda Nebula.”

            The very nature of these objects became the subject of the Great
            Debate between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis. Shapley believed
            that “spiral nebulae” like the <span>“Andromeda Nebula”</span> are
            within the bounds of the Milky Way. Curtis, however, stated that
            they are independent galaxie

          Galaxies that do not classify as either elliptical or spiral are
          called irregular galaxies. They have an abundance of gas and dust
          which means a lot of young stars are being formed. Irregular galaxies
          do not have distinct shapes. The reason for this irregularity is often
          because of the gravitational influence of neighboring galaxies.

          Galaxies that belong to the same groups and clusters mean that they
          are relatively close to each other. Because of that, their gravity can
          affect those that are near them and vice versa. Since dwarf galaxies
          have weaker gravitational pull than bigger galaxies, they are usually
          swallowed by the larger ones. Sometimes, a galaxy can resist the pull
          of another and a collision is avoided. However, the two can still have
          an effect on each other. The force of gravity between these two
          galaxies can still distort their shapes and appearance.

          Even if collisions and mergers sound like a scary thing, the stars in
          a galaxy are spread apart. Astronomers say that there is a very low
          chance of stars smashing against each other when that happens.Instead,
          what is sure is that new stars will form as materials from two
          interacting galaxies combine. With that said, the Solar System will be
          safe when the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy finally collide in the
          far future.

          Black holes become dormant or inactive when no stars and other objects
          are near. The supermassive black hole of the Milky Way, located in
          Sagittarius A*, is thought to have been dormant for a long time.
          However, strong flares were detected from it in 2019 may indicate
          something more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Black holes are very powerful fields that not even light can escape.
          Most of them are remnants of massive stars that have died. So, is
          there always a black hole in the middle of every galaxy?It is believed
          that almost every large galaxy has a black hole in the galactic
          center. Even the Milky Way has one. They are thought to be at the
          center of every galaxy because such powerful forces may be responsible
          for pulling the material that started the creation of galaxies.Black
          holes swallow everything close to them. With that, it consumed
          whatever was near. Those that were beyond its reach started to spin
          around it, forming a new galaxy.
